HowTo:
If you want to use the TOR Network:
1. Verify that you have TOR installed in your system or find a TOR Proxy
2. Write the IP and the PORT of the proxy into the ini file in the [general] section
3. If you want to control TOR proxy to change identity you need to configure both 
   the TOR proxy and the ini file.
   3.1 Configurin the TOR Proxy:
        3.1.1: Go to the configuration file of the proxy and enable the control port.
               The configuration file should be placed here: /etc/tor/torrc
        3.1.2: The password need to be setted in the HashedControlPassword
        3.1.3: Set the password: tor --hash-password YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD

   3.1 The ini file:
        In the tor section write the PORT of the control port you had enable before
        and the password you used to run tor --hash-password YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD

After that the class is ready to work
