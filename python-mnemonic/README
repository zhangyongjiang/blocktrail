==Abstract==

This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence --
a group of easy to remember words -- for the generation of deterministic wallets.

It consists of two parts: generating the mnenomic, and converting it into a
binary seed. This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using
BIP-0032 or similar methods.
