A few days ago I launched just over 15000 messages on Bitmessage. This is how.

This repo includes a OpenCL-based GPU miner and a fast CPU-based (C, OpenSSL) miner.

On Windows the bitmessage miner only uses a single core by default, even on a recent Core i7 this gives around a 250000 checks/sec rate.

Using the CPU miner I am able to achieve rates of up to 5 million checks/sec. Around 20 times that of the stock Bitmessage client.

Using the OpenCL based GPU miner on an Nvidia GTX 680 I achieve around 25 million checks/sec.

The OpenCL version has only been tested on Nvidia chips recently, so it may need some modifications to work on AMD hardware.
