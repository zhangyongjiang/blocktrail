qrcode-canvas
=============
This package is the code [http://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode](node-qrcode) seperated from the boilerplate code to make it work with nodeJS.

This way it's possible to npm install this code for usage with browserify without requiring `node-canvas`, 
which requires a bunch of extenal dependancies to be installed, such as `cairo`.

For usage etc see the original package!

If for w/e reason you want to use this seperation and also use it with NodeJS (which doesn't make much sense) then you can use this fork of the package:
[http://github.com/blocktrail/node-qrcode](node-qrcode)
